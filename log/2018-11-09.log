Messed around with which variables to include and found that with 2 leaf nodes,
    on columns "Sex SibSp Fare" I predicted with complete accuracy

RForest.py -t train.numerized.csv -s test.numerized.csv     \
        -l 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -r 1     \
        -d Survived -i Sex SibSp Fare

    ...so I'm going to work on that now
